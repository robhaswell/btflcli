It can also restore a configuration from a file to a connected flight controller.

The 'dump' command will create files in a directory matching the craft_name, with filenames matching the version of Betaflight. E.g.:

My Quad/BTFL_4.4.2_DUMP.txt
My Quad/BTFL_4.4.2_DIFF.txt

Use the 'load' command and pass a filename to load the contents of a file to the connected flight controller.
